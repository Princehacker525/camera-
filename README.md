Why doesn't it use the official spectator mode?

-----------------------------------------------

Because at the time of making this pack, players in spectator mode have no access to their inventory and are not able to use items they're holding so the functions of this pack wouldn't work.

# How to Use #

--------------

NOTE: This pack has scope for up to 30 camera accounts but it is not intended for regular survival players.

REMEMBER: Focus Points and Path Points are entities that can add to world lag. When you've finished your timelapse, rememeber to delete all of your path points. 

Enable Camera Mode

##################

For each player you wish to become a camera account type the command:

/tag "_GAMERTAG_" add trusted

- Replace _GAMERTAG_ with the player name. It must be exact including capitilization and spaces

The player will need to be online and in the world to have the tag added.

On servers you can run this command from the server console without having to be online, however the tagged player will need to be in the world.

Once tagged, the player will be given items which will allow them to switch modes

Items given to the player must be kept in the same slot or they will not work

MULTIPLAYER

###########

This addon will support up to 30 different tagged accounts.

Each time a new account is tagged as a spectator, it will be part of this cap.

Removing a account by untagging it does not remove it from the list.

Once 30 accounts have been added in total, no more accounts will be able to use this addon on that world without resetting the scoreboards completely.

To force a reset run the commands:

/function fsm_reset

FAQ:

Q) 	It says I'm a camera but I can't fly

A) 	Flying only works with education features enabled. Make sure it is enabled in your game settings.

Q) 	How do keep achievements on this world

A) 	It's very tricky but it can be done with world editing. Look for hasBeenLoadedInCreative

Q) 	Do I have to enable education edition?

A) 	Only if you want your camera accounts to be able to fly

Q) 	I can't use commands or go into creative on my world.

A) 	Then this won't work.

Q) 	The pack fails to install

A) 	Remove any other previous packs and clear the cache. Mojang have details on how to do this.

Q)  The camera doesn't reach each path point exactly

A)  Getting entities to tp to another entity perfectly is hard and jittery. The path features use three different entites to "smooth" out your path to try and prevent jittery motion.

Q) 	The camera movement is still jerky

A)	The key to smooth timelapses, is to make sure your path is nice and smooth with your path points a good distance apart. 

 There's no camera smoothing in bedrock sadly, so you need to work with what you've got.

 Make sure the difference in height between each path point isn't too big and make sure the change in direction from one point to the next isn't to sharp.
